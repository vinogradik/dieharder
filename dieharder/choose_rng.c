  * The way CLI dieharder seeding works is:  a) If Seed is set (e.g.
  * dieharder -S 1... ) then its value will be used to reseed the
  * selected rng at the BEGINNING of each test, or test series for tests
  * such as rgb_bitdist that work their way through a set of ntuples.  If
  * Seed is set for file-based random number generators, it forces a
  * rewind at the beginning of the tests (which should have no effect on
  * stdin-piped streams).
  *
  * Note that using the same seed for all the tests isn't that great from
  * a testing point of view; it is primarily useful for validation runs or
  * to conserve a limited supply of rands from a file by running different
  * tests on the one set of rands.
  *
  * b) If Seed is NOT set (is equal to 0) then the selected rng is seeded
  * one time using the reseed() function, which in turn uses e.g.
  * /dev/random if available or the clock if it is not to generate a
  * unique, moderately unpredictable seed.  The generator will NOT be
  * reseeded (or rewound) if more than one test is run on it, and distinct
  * test results or assessments can be thought of as being drawn as iid
  * samples.
  *
  * Note that results from different tests are likely to be CORRELATED if
  * the same seed is used for each test -- a test with a surplus of some
  * bit pattern -- say 000 -- will also have skewed distributions of all
  * the larger patterns that contain 000.

  * and a chance to try again.

 * ========================================================================
 * select_rng()
 *
 * This code can be executed by either the CLI
 * dieharder or rdieharder to select a generator based on EITHER generator
 * name (via a brute force search) OR generator number.  Number is more
 * convenient for automation and obviously faster, name is perhaps easier
 * to remember.  Note that it produces NO OUTPUT under normal operation
 * and returns -1 if it cannot find the generator however it was entered;
 * it is the responsibility of the UI to handle the error and warn the
 * user.
 *
 * The way it works is it checks name FIRST and if not null, it uses the
 * name it finds.  Otherwise it tries to use the number, where gennum=0
 * actually corresponds to a generator.  It does very minimal bounds
 * checking and will just return -1 if it falls through without finding
 * a generator corresponding to its arguments.
